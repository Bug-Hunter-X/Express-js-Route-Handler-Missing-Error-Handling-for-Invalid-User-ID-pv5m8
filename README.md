# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the `/users/:id` route fails to handle cases where `req.params.id` is not a valid integer.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that attempts to find a user by ID.  It fails to check if the ID is a valid number, leading to potential issues:

1. **TypeErrors:** If `req.params.id` is not a number (e.g., a string), `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing errors in the `find` method.
2. **Unexpected behavior:** If `find` returns `undefined` due to a missing user, no proper error is returned.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to add proper error handling to prevent these issues. It includes:

1. **Type validation:** It checks that `req.params.id` is a valid integer before proceeding.
2. **Error handling:** It gracefully handles the case where a user with the specified ID is not found.

This improved handler provides a more robust and reliable experience.
